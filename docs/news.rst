============================
 The State of this Universe
============================

I will try to give updates from time to time as to what is happening
here.

2021/12/3
=========

It is very much a work in progress, an outline of ideas.

I've tamed the `sphinx`_ enough so that from here most of the
documentation will be in the form of comments in code.

I am still using some things from another of my projects `blume`_
that gives me an interactive framework to work with.  I will likely
have to change a few lines of code as blume settles down.

Here I should be able to move ahead, knowing very little will need
changing here as `blume`_ evolves.   Check the news in blume land for
how that is going.


Plans
-----

There are three main pieces that need fleshing out at this point.

* :ref:`dss`, geodesics, gamma-ray-bursts and red-shift.
* :ref:`cmb`, a model with all the harmonics.
* :ref:`spiral`

I also want to rework my code that is downloading Gaia data, to allow
me to zoom in on a particular part of the data.
