 The Geometry of the Universe
==============================

Abstract
========

For the past four years I have been studying the work of my former
mathematics professor, Colin Rourke.

A new edition of his earlier work, *A new paradigm for the universe*
was published under the title  *The Geometry of the Universe* in 2021.

The book challenges much of standard cosmological theory, whilst
providing a simple elegant model for the universe.

It matches observations without need for dark matter.

The book is timely, as it comes just at a time where our observational
tools are allowing us to test Einstein's General Relativity in some
pretty extreme environments.

Measurements are so precise we can now test some possible modifications
to general relativity.

Further, there are observations now available that allow us to explore
other claims in the book::

  * Sagittarius A* is far too small to drive a full galaxy.

    It is not at the centre, but rather about half way between the Sun
    and the true centre.

  * Any rotating mass drags the space time around it.

    With the magnitude of the effect proportional to the mass and the
    angular velocity and inversely proportional to the distance from
    the centre of the mass.

Where is the Sun?
=================

Where is Sagittarius A*, is it really at the centre of our galaxy?

Axiomatics
==========

So the big bang theory fits the theory, but is it the only possible
solution.

When first introduced to formal mathematics, I was struck with the
thoroughness of the whole procedure.

A set of axioms for numbers was articulated.

It was then shown that any two systems that satisfied these axioms
would be essentially the same in some deep way, a mapping from the
elements in one system to those in the other, preserving all the
structure along the way.

With this in hand and a proof that the numbers as we know and love
them satisfy the set of axioms, things are on solid ground.
