 The Geometry of the Universe
==============================

Abstract
========

I have been studying the work of my former mathematics professor,
Colin Rourke, since I discovered his work through his *A new paradigm
for the universe* which was published in 2017.

In July 2021 a revised and updated verson was published was published
under the title *The Geometry of the Universe*.

The book challenges much of standard cosmological theory, whilst
providing a simple elegant model for the universe.

It matches observations without need for dark matter.

The book is timely, as it comes just at a time where our observational
tools are allowing us to test Einstein's General Relativity in some
pretty extreme environments.

Measurements are so precise we can now test some possible modifications
to general relativity.

Further, there are observations now available that allow us to explore
other claims in the book::

  * Sagittarius A* is far too small to drive a full galaxy.

    It is not at the centre, but rather about half way between the Sun
    and the true centre.

  * Any rotating mass drags the space time around it.

    With the magnitude of the effect proportional to the mass and the
    angular velocity and inversely proportional to the distance from
    the centre of the mass.

What has it got to do with python?

There is a lot of incredible work going on in universities across the
world.  Very complex data analysis, with python at the core of it.

In observational astrophysics new instruments are constantly coming on
line and new observations become available.

The key papers are international collaborations typically involving
fifty or more authors.   There are a lot of parts to data pipelines.

The good news is that once a pipeline is established, it can be fed
with new data as it becomes available.

With software at the heart of analyses it is often also possible to
test a number of different ideas with only a small marginal amount
of work for each idea.

With floods of new observations every year it is important that a wide
enough range of models are considered.

Our understanding of the universe has been a history of climbing hills
looking out over the plane and failing to see the giant mountain
towering above us, if we would only turn round and look.

Where is the Sun?
=================

Where is Sagittarius A*, is it really at the centre of our galaxy?

Axiomatics
==========

So the big bang theory fits the theory, but is it the only possible
solution.

When first introduced to formal mathematics, I was struck with the
thoroughness of the whole procedure.

A set of axioms for numbers was articulated.

It was then shown that any two systems that satisfied these axioms
would be essentially the same in some deep way, a mapping from the
elements in one system to those in the other, preserving all the
structure along the way.

With this in hand and a proof that the numbers as we know and love
them satisfy the set of axioms, things are on solid ground.
