===========

I grew up in the same small Yorkshire town as Fred Hoyle, the
astronomer who coined the term Big Bang.

Later I studied mathematics at Warwick University, with Professor
Colin Rourke as my personal tutor.

It was over 20 years ago, working in Dublin that I discovered python,
and soon after matplotlib.

I contributed a table module to matplotlib, and a version of this now
resides in blume, which is intended to explore tables more
generally. My idea was to create a few examples as I explored data
sets that interested me and use that to shape the table module.

Seven years ago Rourke published, "A New Paradigm for the
Universe". It outlines a complete model for the universe, without the
need for dark matter or dark energy.

When the second edition was published, under the new title, The
Geometry of the Universe, I started the gotu project, to help me
explore the ideas in the book and test the theories in the book with
the incredible data available from space based missions.

Rourke's theory suggests that Fred Hoyle was correct after all and the
Big Bang did not happen. With JWST showing fully formed galaxies soon
after the Big Bang, it is a theory that deserves investigation.

My goal with the gotu project is to raise awareness of Rourke's work
and enable others to explore his ideas with python software and
matplotlib visualisations.
