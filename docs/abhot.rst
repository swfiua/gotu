 A Brief History of Time
=========================

It is helpful to compare *The Geometry of the Universe* to Stephen
Hawking's, A Brief History of Time.

A best selling book that aimed to be accessible to a very wide
audience, aiming to explain nothing less than the entire history of
the universe.

Published in 1988, some 30 years have passed, since Fred
Hoyle's, *The Nature of the Universe*.

It is a period during which observational astronomy has made dramatic
strides.

Hoyle sets the scene for this sixty year adventure, describing the
1960's view of how the universe may have come about.

It includes a chapter entitled, *The Expanding Universe*, as does
Hawking's brief history.

Hoyle speculated that the aparent expansion would be a balanced if
matter was spontaneously created at a fairly modest rate.

By the time of Hawking, black holes had evolved from hypothetical
object to indirect observation.  

Hawking was very much focussed on unifying quantum mechanics and
Einstein's general relativity.  With the big bang theory, comes the
belief that at some point the universe was in such a tiny space that
quantum effects must be taken into account.

At the big bang, quantum effects come into the equation, so to
understand the fundamental features of the universe you needed to
model the very first instant of the explosion, when everything is so
close and a quantum mystery.

There are mathematical connections with black holes and Hawking
describes how, taking quantum mechanics into account these holes can
evaporate over time.

These two book give a good reminder of how new a theory the `Big Bang`
theory is, and also the pace at which we are able to make new
observations of the universe.

Black holes were barely discussed by Hoyle.

By 1988, the theory is firmly established, with observations such as
the Cosmic Microwave Background having been taken as confirmation of
the theory.

Hawking mentions the discovery of quasars led to Hoyle abandonning his
continuous creation model.   Quasars are highly red-shifted and so are
assumed to be very distant objects of extraordinary power.   The fact
that we do not see these objects nearer to us is deemed to be an
indication that quasars were an earlier stage of the evolution of the
universe, and hence very much further away.

Fast forward to today, and Rourke shows how quasars could in fact be
relatively close, low power objects, where the emitted radiation is
red-shifted due to the intense gravitational field, in accordance with
general relativity.

Hawking's worked in theoretical physics, focussing on quantum theories
of gravity, and much of the book focusses on quantum effects and notes
similarities between the event horizon of a black hole and the big
bang singularity.

Hawking asks four questions regarding the origin of the universe::

  1. Why was the early universe so hot?

  2. Why is the universe so uniform on a large scale?

  3. Why did the universe start out with so nearly the critical rate
     of expansion that separates models that collapse from those that
     go on expanding forever?

  4. Despite the fact that the universe is so uniform and homogeneous
     on a large scale it contains local irregularities, such as stars
     and galaxies.

     What is the origin of these density fluctuations?


It is left to Rourke to untangle this puzzle.  If you enjoy a good
brain teaser then this book is for you.

The short answer, imagine what if there was an essentially infinite
space of galaxies, just like we see, what would the whole look like?

Q1. Why was it so hot?  It still is, it's bigger than you realise.

Q2. Why so uniform?  It may have been there a very, very long time.

Q3. See Q2. The universe has had a long time to achieve some sort of
dynamic equilibrium.

Q4. Everything is still resonating, a self sustaining wobble as seen
in the CMB.

Rourke takes the simplest model that fits the equations and shows
space time is more complex than we realise.

Happily, with an adjusted perspective, a very elegant and economical
model shows how to interpret our observations.

For good measure Rourke addresses all these issues::

     * redshift

     * quasars

     * Cosmic Microwave Background

     * Gamma Ray Bursts

     * Dark Matter - not required.


One subject not covered by Hawking, is dark matter, much of his early
research happened before the galactic rotation problem became widely
apparent.

It is helpful to think of dark matter as the error term in general
relativity.

Indeed, this is what Rourke does, with a minor adjustment to the
standard solutions to Einstein's equations.  An assumption that the
rotation of any body also affects the surrounding space time.


Interlude
=========

At this point it should be apparent that this is a complex story.

Much of the complexity comes from the incredible success of the last
sixty years of astronomical observation: radio telescopes, space
telescopes, satellite observations, planetary observations and
gravitational wave observatories.

These observations have provided a ripe field for speculation and
ingenious solutions.

The big bang theory imposes a 14 billion year time scale on matters
and this is increasingly becoming problematic.

The introduction of dark matter further muddies the water as it can
always be invoked whenever observations are otherwise hard to
explain.

In short, anyone faced with arguing that the Big Bang theory is a
mistake is faced with a veritable mountain range of peaks to overcome
before being able to make their argument.

Rourke slowly unpicks the puzzle.

There are some bold predictions along the way, in particular about Sag
A*, the giant black hole thought to be at the centre of the Milky Way.
