 Introduction to The Geometry of the Universe
==============================================

The workshop will feature modules from my gotu project, exploring the
geometry of the universe.

It will cover downloading and visualising data from the James Webb
Space Telescope and the Gaia mission to visualise the rotation curve
for the Milky Way.

Simulate the Milky Way's rotation curve assuming the Sciama Principle::

   a rotating mass induces a rotation on the surrounding space time
   with a magnitude proportional to the mass and inversely
   proportional to the 

           
Compare to the Gaia image.


Introduction to de Sitter Space.  This will use matplotlib to
visualise geodesics in de Sitter Space, allowing us to explore the
subtle relation between redshift and distance.

Downloading and visualising the supernovae data and testing whether it is consistent with de Sitter Space.

Since gotu uses blume, the workshop will begin with an introduction to blume.

The goal is for attendees to have at least half the workshop time to
explore the ideas and data sets for themselves.
