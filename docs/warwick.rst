 Institute of Mathematics, Warwick University
==============================================


After my early years in Bingley, I went to study mathematics at
Warwick University.  My personal tutor was Professor Colin Rourke.

He taught undergraduate analysis, using a method he had developed for
the Open University. 

I very much enjoyed the mathematics at Warwick, my introduction to
rigorous, axiomatic based mathematics.

It was :ref:`Christopher Zeeman` that had put together the Mathematics
Institute and who set the scene for the undergraduate course with the
*Foundations of Mathematics*.

I particularly enjoyed algebraic topics, such as Galois Theory and
Fermat's Last Theorem.  I could follow proofs and ideas, always
marvelled at the wonderful twists that would lead to an elusive proof.

I graduated with first class honours and left acacdemia until many
years later that I discovered Professor Rourke's work in cosmology.
