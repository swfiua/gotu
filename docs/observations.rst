 Observations
==============

Here is a collection of links to papers, with a brief note as to why I
found it interesting.

Every few days I hear of new research, driven by the wonderful state
of observational astronomy, or rather, observational physics in
general.

With all the space and earth based instruments, observational physics
is revealing new information almost every day.

There can be a significant time lag in between observations and papers
being released.

Many observatories are in the early years of their expected life use,
often getting more sensitive over time.

It takes time to get papers reviewed and published.

On the plus side, once a paper is published, it is much less work to
repeat the data processing side with more data.   

For example, the gravitational wave is expecting the observatories to
start a new observational run at the end of 2021.

It will be interesting to see how the sensitivity of the detectors has
increased since the last observation run.

Will we see more so called *multi-messenger* events, gravitational
waves accompanied by a gamma-ray burst?

ABSTRACT

We measure the central kinematics for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo
I using integrated-light measurements and previously published
data. We find a steady rise in the velocity dispersion from 300 00
into the center. The integrated light kinematics provide a velocity
dispersion of 11.76 ± 0.66 km s −1 inside 75seconds. After applying
appropriate corrections to crowding in the central regions, we achieve
consistent velocity dispersion values using velocities from individual
stars.  Crowding corrections need to be applied when targeting
individual stars in high density stellar environments. From integrated
light, we measure the surface brightness profile and find a shallow
cusp towards the center. Axisymmetric, orbit-based models measure the
stellar mass-to-light ratio, black hole mass and parameters for a dark
matter halo. At large radii it is important to consider possible tidal
effects from the Milky Way so we include a variety of assumptions
regarding the tidal radius. For every set of assumptions, models
require a central black hole consistent with a mass 3.3 ± 2×10 6 M
. The no-black-hole case for any of our assumptions is excluded at
over 95% significance, with 6.4 < ∆χ 2 < 14. A black hole of this mass
would have significant effect on dwarf galaxy formation and evolution.
The dark halo parameters are heavily affected by the assumptions for
the tidal radii, with the circular velocity only constrained to be
above 30 km s −1 . Reasonable assumptions for the tidal radius result
in stellar orbits consistent with an isotropic distribution in the
velocities. These more realistic models only show strong constraints
for the mass of the central black hole.

The observation here is a strong absorption line, consistent with
water absorption, when redshift is taken into account.

There is a plot of the observed spectrum, in the 70-120 GHz range,
which with a redshift of 6.34 correspondsponding to emission
frequency in the range 500-900 GHz

The paper seems to be assuming that all the redshift is cosmological
and that absorption is happening relatively close to the quasar, so
that it is subject to the same cosmological redshift.

The paper proposes a model for the origin of the observed absorbtion
lines.  The model allows the temperature of the dust to be fitted to
observations, giving an estimate of the Cosmic Microwave Background
temperature at that distance.

Recall, this is a very high redshift quasar, believed to be at
considerable distance.

It is a technique that has been used before on other systems.   There
appears to be an emerging relation between distance (as determined by
redshift) and Cosmic Microwave Background temperature.

What is really happening?
-------------------------

The redshift is a combination of cosmological and gravitational
redshift. 

What if the light leaving the quasar is subject to very significant
gravitational red shift explaining most of the redshift?

Our estimate of the power output of the system will be significantly
inflated.

There is no reason to assume that dust is not also close to the source
of the radiation and as such will likely be warmer than the CMB.

Now if we assume that most of the redshift is gravitational and that
these objects are actually quite close, we might expect to find a
natural relationship between the mass of the quasar and the
temperature of its surrounding water clouds.

In turn, since redshift depends on the mass, there is a relation
between temperature and redshift.

Todo
----

Appendix C of the book has lots of good information on quasars.

Should use this to examine relationship between redshift and temperature.
