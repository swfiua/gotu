====================
 Nicolas Copernicus
====================

1543, published *On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres*.   This
was considered the birth of modern astronomy.  It presented the theory
that the Sun is the centre of the solar system.

The *Copernican Principle* is that no particular location should be
special.

In the perfect Copernican Principle, this idea is extended to time as
well as space.  In a relativistic universe, this makes sense since
time and space are inextricably intertwined.

The Big Bang theory is not compatible with this principle, since it
includes a very special event, the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years
ago.

Further, according to the theory, we just happen to be living at a
very special time, one where we can just see the earliest moments
following the Big Bang.

In 100 billion years, if the theory is correct, the only galaxies we
will be able to see will be those currently gravitationally bound to
our galaxy.
