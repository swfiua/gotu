Chapter 4 of the book has the title, *Sciama's Principle*.

It is central to the story, indeed at the end of the chapter it is
stated that one of the aims of the book is to reawaken Sciama's
approach to dynamics.

The Weak Sciama Principle
-------------------------

::

   A mass m at distance r from P rotating with angular velocity 2
   contributes a rotation of kmw/r to the inertial frame at P.

   k is a constant.
