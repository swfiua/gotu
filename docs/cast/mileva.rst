 Mileva MariÄ‡
==============

Mileva was Einsteins's wife from 1903 to 1919.  She collaborated with
Einstein.  There is debate over how much she contributed to his early
work and the Annus Mirabilis papers.

It is noted that all the other members of this cast of characters were
men, so Mileva represents all the many women whose work was not
recognised at the time.
