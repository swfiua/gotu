   The Big Bang is an Exploding Myth

   Jayant Narlikar


Fred Hoyle was the original Big Bang sceptic, and founder of the term,
Big Bang.

Fred Hoyle guided Jayant Narlikar through his doctorate in theoretical
cosmology at Cambridge in 1963.

Colin Rourke provided a geometric model for the universe.
   
All three are no longer with us.   Hoyle died in 2001.  It was around
that time that Rourke started his work on cosmology, so was not in
time to point Hoyle in the right direction.


Rourke died in December 2024, believing it could be another 50 years
before the community moves away from the big bang theory.

I had submitted the talk proposal, :ref:`birch` to the :ref:`gr24`
conference before I learnt of his passing.  The talk was not accepted,
which was likely a blessing.  It turns out the story is more complex
than I originally thought, I had over-looked the importance of
understanding the :ref:`quasar` galaxy spectrum, as explained in his
book.

My explorations of the :ref:`desi` data are very promising in this
respect.  There are also the :ref:`little red dots` to explore.  The
challenge is to separate intrinsic redshift from cosmological.

With Rourke's passing it seemed more important than ever for me to
explore gravitational waves in the context of his geometric model for
the universe.  Glasgow was an excellent opportunity to explore the
world of gravitational wave science and seek out others that might
have an interested in static universe theories.

Sadly, it was during the conference that I learn of Jayant Narlikar's
passing in June 2025.  I spoke to a number of researchers from India
during the conference, there was a lot of excitement about the
prospects for the Indian LIGO.  One recalled the quote on his office
door and also broke the news of his passing.

It is not clear if Jayant Narlikar was aware of Rourke's work, but he
remained confident that the Big Bang theory was a mistake.

There is no continuous creation in Rourke's model for the universe,
but there is a continuouse replenishment of matter in our visible
universe through new arrivals.

The idea is that the universe is vast and ancient, a view shared by
this trio, myself and many others.

It is also curved, that curvature creates a visibility horizon at the
Hubble distance.

This is what creates the redshift we see, but it also creates
blue-shift.

When a galaxy becomes visible for the first time, we see it's entire
history in a short period of time.  Rourke suggests this as an
explanation for gamma-ray bursts and provides a model which fits the
observations.

It is the same for any gravitational waves that we see: all the
gravitational waves it has emitted through it's life time arrive at
the same time!

There are natural parallels with the merging black hole model.
