We had the observations of the pulsars
======================================

Dear Christopher,

I am writing to thank you for all the work you and the team at Glasgow
University put into the :ref:`gr24` conference last July.

I attended the conference, including the early career workshop and had
a wonderful experience. 

The conference has had an immense impact on my personal understanding
and appreciation of gravitational wave science.  

It was the work of Professor Colin Rourke, of Warwick University that
was the reason for going to the conference.  Professor Rourke was my
personal tutor as an undergraduate at Warwick University in the early
1980's.

I hope you will enjoy his book, the Geometry of the Universe, which I
sent in thanks not only for the work you put into the conference
but also because it was a conversation with you at the conference that
has very much help focus my attendion on crux of the matter.

I commented to you how much I admire the dedication of people who had
spent decades working to detect something that might not exist.  You
responded, *"We had the observations of the binary pulsars."*

I was aware of the Hulse-Taylor observations, but had not appreciated
how compelling they were to the community.  

The reason for my question was a belief that there is another
potential explanation for the gravitational waves we are seeing.

The explanation is also a confirmation of Einstein's general
relativity and involves black holes.  It has event horizons and extreme
space-time curvature.  The Kerr metric plays an important part.

The story begins with Professor Rourke, a brilliant topologist with a
deep understanding of geometry.

It was not until 2017 that I discovered his work on cosmology.  Since
this time I corresponded regularly with Professor Rourke.  In
particular, we had significant discussions about gravitational waves,
both in regards to the Ligo/Virgo/Kagra detections and the Pulsar
Timing Array results.

Rourke explores de Sitter space as model of the universe.  He proposes
that gamma-ray bursts are in fact new galaxies arriving in our visible
universe, with light highly blue-shifted, we see the arrival's entire
history in a short space of time.

Is the same true for the gravitational waves that are emitted by the
galaxy?  The wave front arrives like a tsunami, with all the waves
from the galaxy arriving at the same time.

Rourke's model also requires the Sciama Principle, which he adopts as
an additional assumption on top of Einstein's General Relativity.

This Principle states that the amplitude of gravitational waves
emitted by a body at distance *r* from the body is *km/r*.  Where *m*
is the mass of the body and *k* is a constant.   

Note that the *1/r* factor is consistent with gravitational wave
science, where we use the amplitude of the wave at detection to
determine the distance of the source.

Rourke shows that galactic rotation curves can be explained with the
adoption of the Sciama Principle, as an additional assumption to
general relativity.

Without the Sciama Principle, the wave a body emits must follow the
Kerr metric, which is the unique vacuum solution for a rotating body,
since this is the unique solution for the general relativity
equations for a rotating body in a vacuum.

How can the Sciama Principle also apply?

The Kerr metric determines the penalty you will pay, in terms of
angular momentum, for any rotation giving rise to the angular
momentum.  The Sciama Principle determines how the resulting
distortion of space time will propogate through space time.

If we also assume that a black hole's angular momentum is proportional
to it's mass, we have the wave's amplitude proportional to the mass.

Further, the period of the wave is determined by the angular velocity
of the body.

So while the Kerr metric is the unique solution if space is a vacuum,
Rourke proposes that space is not a vacuum.

The detection of gravitational waves is itself a confirmation of this
fact.  Space is a medium through which gravitational waves travel and
the amplitude of waves reduces inversely with distance.

General relativity is a very good theory because much of the time it
is possible to ignore the waves that a body sends out.

Notable exceptions are when there is a very large mass or when two
bodies are close to each other.

A large mass explains galactic rotation curves: a super-massive black
hole at the centre of each galaxy drags space time around with it.

The mass has to be truly supermassive, for a galaxy the size of the
Milky Way a mass of 10-100 billion solar masses would be necessary.

Rourke said that Sagittarius A* cannot be at the centre of our galaxy,
since it is simply not large enough to drive a mature galaxy.  He
proposes the true centre is likely as much as twice as far away and
that Sgr A* is a modest sized quasar.

This was the motivation for the *Where Is the Sun?* artwork that I
submitted to the conference.

.. image::  images/witsart.png

The image shows two versions of the galactic rotation curve based on
two different assumptions about where the centre of the Milky Way: at
Sgr A*, or at twice the distance of Sgr A*.

The plots have distance from the galactic centre on the x-axis and
tangential velocity of stars on the y-axis.   The data is from the
Gaia mission.

Columns are normalised so we see at each radius the proportion of
observations at each tangental velocity.

There is a lot to see in the images.  There is classic flat asymptote
of galactic rotation curves, that gave rise to the belief in dark
matter.

The good news is that the Pulsar Timing Array can be used to compare
between different models for the galactic gravitational potential:
modelling oscillations in the Milky Way's stellar medium.

This brings us to the nanohertz gravitational waves, an oscillation of
10m over the period of a year.

With the Sciama Principle, oscillations from distant galaxies
dominate.  This is why Sciama chose a factor of 1/r, as he was aiming
to satisfy Mach's Principle by showing what determines our inertial
frame.

I have done simulations that show that the observed waves are
commensurate with the observed waves, based on Rourke's model.  It
will clearly be worthwhile to look at pulsar observations through the
lens of Rourke's model, using the Sciama Principle to model the
galactic potential.

Returning to the pulsar observations, where orbits are observed to be
decaying according to the Kerr metric.

This puzzle requires an explanation, but first some observations about
binary pulsars.

* They are often found distant from the galactic plane.

* They may have large *kick velocities*.

  This means the system is moving 200 to 500 km/s faster than the
  typical 200km/s.  In the wits image, it is the part above the
  200km/s asymptote on which the sun lies.

* Strong correlation between polarisation and kick direction.

* Globular clusters have more binary pulsars than they should have
  given the low escape velocity for the globular cluster.

In Rourke's model, distance from galactic plane is an indicator of
age.  Globular clusters are also known to be older objects.  The pulsars
they have are likely not recent captures, so why have they not already
merged?

Rourke notes that the Sciama Principle allows a body to absorb angular
momentum of infalling matter.  It is not hard to imagine a situation
where the orbit reaches a critical radius and receives a kick which
separates the two bodies in the binary, without need for a supernova.

A third area where the Sciama waves become important is the wave-particle
duality of the quantum world.  This is particularly noticeable with
light, where the waves and the particles are both travelling at the
speed of light.

This is also why general relativity is funamentally incompatible with
quantum mechanics: it ignores the waves bodies are creating in
space-time, whereas quantum theory explicitly includes them.

Rourke's idea of adopting the Sciama Principle as an additional
assumption to General Relativity is what is needed to make it
compatible with quantum mechanics.

We can also ask how does matter curve space time?  What is the
mechanism?  It is because rotations of matter induce rotations of
space time, which can be captured very well, to a first approximation
as curvature.

When the spin of binary pulsars is taken into account, there is not
final inspiral.   Long before that the waves from the spin come into
play.

The good news is Einstein and de Sitter space come to the rescue to
explain the waves we are observing.

As a body enters our backwards light cone we see all the gravitational
waves it has ever emitted in a short period of time.

Furthermore, the situation is exactly analgous to the merging black
hole situation.

The wave front we see will be shaped according to the Kerr metric, but
there is a hyperbolic rotation at the same time.

Just as there is would be if black holes merge.  As they get closer
and closer time slows exponentially.

The intriguing possibility that universe has rewarded the magnificent
work on gravitational wave detection with exactly what was expected,
but the source is something that is almost indistinguishable from the
mistaken belief.

Fortunately, there are ways to distinguish between these two models,
based on prior and posterior distributions of parameters as new
observations come in.
