 Dear Christopher
==================

I am writing to thank you for all the work you and the team at Glasgow
University put into the :ref:`gr24` conference last July.

I attended the conference, including the early career workshop and had
a wonderful experience. 

The conference has had an immense impact on my personal understanding
and appreciation of gravitational wave science.  

I have spent the rest of the summer trying to write up why I went to
the conference and how my ideas have evolved as a result.  

It was the work of Professor Colin Rourke, of Warwick University that
was the reason for going to the conference.  Professor Rourke was my
personal tutor as an undergraduate in the early 1980's.

I hope you will enjoy his book, the Geometry of the Universe, which I
am sending in thanks not only for the work you put into the conference
but also because it was a conversation with you at the conference that
has very much help focus my attendion on crux of the matter.

I commented to you how much I admire the dedication of people who had
spent decades working to detect something that might not exist.  You
responded, *"We had the observations of the binary pulsars."*

I was aware of the Hulse-Taylor observations, but had not appreciated
how compelling they were to the community.  


Rourke was a brilliant topologist with a deep understanding of
geometry.

It was not until 2017 that I discovered his work on cosmology.  Since
this time I corresponded regularly with Professor Rourke.  In
particular, we had significant discussions about gravitational waves,
both in regards to the Ligo/Virgo/Kagra detections and the Pulsar
Timing Array results.

Rourke explores de Sitter space as model of the universe.  He proposes
that gamma-ray bursts are in fact new galaxies arriving in our visible
universe, with light highly blue-shifted, we see the arrival's entire
history in a short space of time.

Presumably, the same is true for the gravitational waves that are
emitted by the galaxy?  The wave front arrives like a tsunami, with
all the waves from the galaxy arriving at the same time.

Rourke's model also requires the Sciama Principle, which he adopts as
an additional assumption on top of Einstein's General Relativity.

This Principle states that the amplitude of gravitational waves
emitted by a body at distance *r* from the body is *km/r*.  Where *m*
is the mass of the body and *k* is a constant.   

Note that the *1/r* factor is consistent with gravitational wave
science, where we use the amplitude of the wave at detection to
determine the distance of the source.

Rourke shows that galactic rotation curves can be explained with the
adoption of the Sciama Principle.  



The issue here is that we are observing bodies moving according to the
Kerr metric, which has waves dropping off with a factor of *1/r^3*.

Further, this is the unique solution for the general relativity
equations for a rotating body in a vacuum, how can the Sciama
Principle also apply? What if both apply, but sometimes you can ignore
the Sciama part?

The Kerr metric determines the penalty you will pay, in terms of
angular momentum, for any rotation giving rise to the angular
momentum.   The Sciama Principle determines how that wave will
propogate through space time.

Rourke notes that two inertial frames that differ only by a constant
velocity are deemed equivalent in special and general relativity and
concludes that uniform motion should have no inertial effect on the
surrounding universe.

He then notes that you can change the angular momentum of a body by
adding a constant velocity, but that angular velocity cannot be so
changed.

If we also assume that a black hole's angular momentum is proportional
to it's mass, we have the wave's amplitude proportional to the mass.

Further, the period of the wave is determined by the angular velocity
of the body.

So while the Kerr metric is the unique solution is space is not a
vacuum, Rourke proposes that space is not a vacuum.

The detection of gravitational waves is itself a confirmation of this
fact.  Space is a medium through which gravitational waves travel and
the amplitude of waves reduces inversely with distance.

General relativity is a very good theory because much of the time it
is possible to ignore the waves that a body sends out.

Notable exceptions are when there is a very large mass or when two
bodies are close to each other.

The former explains galactic rotation curves: a large rotating mass at
the centre of every galaxy that drags space time around with it.

The latter case explains the pulsar observations:  the binaries are
far enough apart that the waves emitted due to their roation can be
ignored for now.

A third area where these waves become important is the wave-particle
duality of the quantum world.  This is particularly noticeable with
light, where the waves and the particles are both travelling at the
speed of light.

This is also why general relativity is funamentally incompatible with
quantum mechanics: it ignores the waves bodies are creating, whereas
quantum theory explicitly includes them.
