**A quest from Bingley to Glasgow in search of the truth of
gravitational waves**

How an old guy from a ski school, came to believe the big bang might not
have happened and attends an astrophysics conference in search of truth.

As I am not in academia, I listed my institution as *Acad√©mie Camp
Fortune, Chelsea, Quebec*, where I work as a ski instructor doing
practical experiments in gravity, in a low friction environment.

I am fortunate that this gives me a great deal of time to ponder the
mysteries of the universe.



Rourke ends chapter 4 of The Geometry of the Universe with a
*coda*::

  Sciama's initiative to base a dynamical theory on Mach's
  principle as formulated in Sciama's principle, has never
  been followed up and this approach to dynamics remains
  dormant.  One of the aims of this book is to reawaken
  this approach.

It is my belief that the Sciama principle is the best explanation of
the gravitational waves that both the Pulsar Timing Array and the
LIGO, Virgo and Kagra detectors are seeing.
