**A quest from Bingley to Glasgow in search of the truth of
gravitational waves**

How an old guy from a ski school, came to believe the big bang might not
have happened and attends an astrophysics conference in search of truth.

As I am not in academia, I listed my institution as *Acad√©mie Camp
Fortune, Chelsea, Quebec*, where I work as a ski instructor doing
practical experiments in gravity, in a low friction environment.

I am fortunate that this gives me a great deal of time to ponder the
mysteries of the universe.

Since returning from Glasgow, I have spent the summer trying to write
up why I went on this journey.  It is taking longer than expected as
the conference itselt has very much helped focus my attention on the
crux of this matter.

In a 2018 discussion on black holes there is this fascinating comment
from Colin Rourke::

   There is another possible more important problem that I have with
   black holes.  The fundamental inertial drag hypothesis that explains
   the dynamics of galaxies needs every mass in the universe to have a
   well-defined rotation (or a well-defined inertial frame in which it is
   static).  But the current fiction is that a BH is a POINT SINGULARITY
   and therefore it has nothing to define its rotation.  I mention this
   problem in passing in the book, but I did not stress it because I did
   not want to murder yet another sacred cow.

The story is one of Kerr and Sciama, how both are right at the same
time.

And how there is another explanation for the observations.   This
explanation has the following in common::

* We are seeing black holes

* the waves are shaped by the Kerr metric

* events have an inspiral, a peak and a ringdown

* we can estimate the mass involved in an event

* we expect co-incident gamma-ray bursts, depending on the mass involved

* the mass redshift degeneracy is of interest

* the observation is a confirmation of Einstein's general relativity.  

In the new explanation::

* the masses are likely of the order of a million solar masses
* we are feeling the influence of new angular momentum for the first
  time.
* we see the entire history of the body's affect on the surrounding
  space time in a very short period of time.

In the ringdown phase, the blue shift decreases rapidly.  The shape of
the curve allows two parameters, theta and phi to be estimate, that
will also define the shape of any gamma-ray burst.



Rourke ends chapter 4 of The Geometry of the Universe with a
*coda*::

  Sciama's initiative to base a dynamical theory on Mach's
  principle as formulated in Sciama's principle, has never
  been followed up and this approach to dynamics remains
  dormant.  One of the aims of this book is to reawaken
  this approach.

It is my belief that the Sciama principle is the best explanation of
the gravitational waves that both the Pulsar Timing Array and the
LIGO, Virgo and Kagra detectors are seeing.
