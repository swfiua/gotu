===================
 GR24 and Amaldi16
===================


Earlier in the year I submitted a proposal to this conference in
Glasgow about general relativity and gravitational waves :ref:`birch`.


   Revive interest in theories based on the Sciama Principle
   [coda in the book]

   Is there anything else?  Colin Rourke, on light.

   The CMB and gravitational waves should be in equilibrium due to the
   Rees-Sciama effect?

   When an old guy from a ski school, who believes the big bang did
   not happen attended an astrophysics conference.


After submitting the talk, I realised the subject was a little more
complex than I had hoped, requiring not just de Sitter Space, but also
the model of galaxy evolution outlined in Rourke's work, where
galaxies are characterised by the size of their central black holes.

The release of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
has provided ideal data to help determine the split between
cosmological and intrinsic redshift.


The key idea is that smaller black holes exhibit intrinsic redshift,
with light coming from close to the black hole.  As the central black
hole and galaxy grow the redshift diminishes and is negligble in a
full size galaxy.

The talk was not accepted, which was somewhat of a relief.  It has
taken me some time to understand what is going on with galaxy spectra.

I had also made the submission before I had heard the very sad news
that Colin Rourke had passed away.

I decided I would still attend the conference, as it gave an ideal
opportunity to get the latest information on gravitational wave
observations and next generation detectors.  I was not disappointed. 

As I am not in academia, I listed my institution as *Acad√©mie Camp
Fortune, Chelsea, Quebec*, where I work as a ski instructor doing
practical experiments in gravity, in a low friction environment.

I am fortunate that this gives me a great deal of time to ponder the
mysteries of the universe.



Early Career Workshop
=====================

Despite my advanced age, I felt it would be worthwhile to attend the
early career workshop before the main conference.


GW231123
========

GW170817
========

Pulsar Timing Array
===================

Sciama and Kerr
===============

Sciama says frame dragging drops off with 1/r, Kerr says it is 1/r**3.

Kerr assumes space-time is a vacuum and is the unique solution for a
vacuum.

Gravitational waves are assumed to propagate at the speed of light (1
part in 10-15 difference according to GW170817), with amplitude
reducing with a 1/r relationship, per Sciama.


The River Clyde Gravitational Observatory
=========================================

Tensions in cosmology

DESI in the LRG at redshift 0.7
-------------------------------

Essentionally, in the DESI dataset, if you assume redshift gives
distance then the 0.7 bucket is out of whack with the scale factor we
would assume.

In Rourke's model many of the LRG are relatively near objects, but
with significant intrinsic redshift from the AGN.

Priors
======

Bayesian probability is in wide use through the community and there is
considerable awareness of the problems that can arise with priors.

I particularly enjoyed the talk on biases from choice of m1 in a
merger. (which talk?)

What prior should be used for, what if Colin, Fred and Jayant were
rigth?

Did the conference change my priors?
------------------------------------

Where is the Sun?

The Future
==========

HMXW - half max width for spectra (check acronym in little red dot
paper).  Use on DESI via spectral matching stuff.
