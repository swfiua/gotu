GW150914

The first gravitational wave detection.

I heard about this event during a Python conference in 2016 around the
time of the announcement.

Brandon Rhodes fave a keynote where he mentioned the recent
announcement by the LIGO team and how python was used at key parts of
the analysis.

The detection of these ripples in space time was a stunning
achievement, after decates of hunting.

Two black holes, 35.6 and 30.6 solar masses merge to form a final mass
of just 63.1 solar masses.

Energy emitted as gravitational waves: 3.1 solar masses.

Chirp mass 28.6 Suns and at a distance of 430 Mpc.

There was a lot of interest at the conference and a number of
attendees with good knowledge of the discovery.

It was not until :ref:`GW170817` that I started to wonder whether the
signals being detected might have another explanation than merging
black holes.

By that time I had read Rourke's work and was aware of the hypothesis
that gamma-ray bursts may be the arrivals of new galaxies in our
visible universe. 

This was around 2018.  In a discussion on black holes there is this
fascinating comment from Colin Rourke::


   There is another possible more important problem that I have with
   black holes.  The fundamental inertial drag hypothesis that explains
   the dynamics of galaxies needs every mass in the universe to have a
   well-defined rotation (or a well-defined inertial frame in which it is
   static).  But the current fiction is that a BH is a POINT SINGULARITY
   and therefore it has nothing to define its rotation.  I mention this
   problem in passing in the book, but I did not stress it because I did
   not want to murder yet another sacred cow.
