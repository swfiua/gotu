 The Big Red Geometry Book
===========================

Many years ago, studying algebra in a distant land, some helpful
students had written a little guide to the subject.

It was, "The Big Red Algebra Book" and was a guide to keeping a pet
algebra.

It was indeed red, I may still have a copy, hand written, with
cartoons and reproduced by some ancient magic.

It also happened to be a rather good guide to the whole subject and
why it might even matter.

I am hoping that this project here will turn into a big red *geometry*
book.

It feels an appropriate title for the project as it is very much a
story of how geometry changes wavelength over time, with red shift at
the centre of the story.
