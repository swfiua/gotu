  Exploring the Milky Way with astropy, matplotlib and Gaia
=============================================================

Europython 2022, Dublin
=======================

The James Webb Space Telescope edition.

The first pictures from James Webb arrived during the conference, good
times ahead for cosmologists.

The space telesope has a giant, cool eye that sees the heat emitted by
the dust in the universe.

Further afield, it will see galaxies receding so fast they're only
visible in the infra-red.

The first picture I saw of M74

Back to Europython.

A *Gilectomy* keynote.  No longer does python without the GIL slow
down.  A delightful talk on the problem of tracking references in a
fully multi-threaded world.

People working on *pyiodide*, I have decided to explore this project
more directly.

I am particularly interested in the *pyiodide*.

During the sprint I managed to get *gotu.gaia* limping along again.

I really need to unify *wits* and *gaia*.

I am starting a *gotu.jwst* module.  The plan is to be able to explore
the data behind some of the incredible images the space telescope is
giving us.
