Europython 2022, Dublin
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The first pictures from James Webb arrived during the conference, good
times ahead for cosmologists.  The first picture I saw of M74.

A *Gilectomy* keynote.  No longer does python without the GIL slow
down.  A delightful talk on the problem of tracking references in a
fully multi-threaded world.

People working on *pyiodide*, I have decided to explore this project
more directly.

During the sprint I managed to get *gotu.gaia* limping along again.
I really need to unify *wits* and *gaia*.

I am starting a *gotu.jwst* module.  The plan is to be able to explore
the data behind some of the incredible images the space telescope is
giving us.

-------

Cosmology

Units

Constants

Coordinates

Astroquery, tables

Personal Projects
=================

karmapi, 2016
-------------

Tools to record and display data from raspberry pi's with sensehats
and cameras.

Personal toolkit for viewing things with matplotlib.

Principles
++++++++++

Do not re-invent the wheel

No module should exceed 1000 lines

Fix it upstream

Is there anything better than a folder full of 100 line python
scripts?

There is nothing a layer of abstraction cannot fix.  Can it be done
without adding complexity?

It is impossible to do anything if I obey all the principles.

The Geometry of the Universe

A geometric model for the universe with no need for dark matter or
dark energy.

What if the big bang did not happen?
====================================

Bayes Theorem
-------------

.. math::

   P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)


Copernicus
----------

The Perfect Copernican Principle:

There should be no special times or places in the Universe.

A story with no beginning

A time and a place when everything started?

Fred Hoyle
----------

Fred Hoyle coined the term Big Bang.

He believed in an essentially static universe.

Suggested just one new atom appearing in each skyscraper sized volume
of space per year would balance the expansion.

Colin Rourke
------------

Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at Warwick University.

Good news: No need for dark matter.

Bad news: Sagittarius A* is too small to drive the Milky Way.

Colin Rourke proposes de Sitter space as a space-time which exhibits
redshift, but has no overall expansion.

Shows that the Sciama Principle can explain galactici rotation curves
without need for dark matter.

Gaia and wits
=============

Where is the Sun?

Can Gaia help answer this question?


Galactic Rotation Curves
========================

Xaowei paper.

Tangential velocities beyond 25kpc from the galactic centre are lower
than expected.

Sciama Principle, Denis Sciama, 1953
====================================

On the origin of inertia.

A mass

.. math::

   M

with angular velocity

.. math::

   \omega

induces a rotation of:

.. math::

   M \omega / r

at a distance

.. math::

   r

from the centre of the mass.

Introduction to the Geometry of the Universe

It's a big subject ;)
