What does a de Sitter/Sciama prior look like?

Europython 2022, Dublin
=======================

The first pictures from James Webb arrived during the conference, good
times ahead for cosmologists.

The first picture I saw of M74.

A *Gilectomy* keynote.  No longer does python without the GIL slow
down.  A delightful talk on the problem of tracking references in a
fully multi-threaded world.

People working on *pyiodide*, I have decided to explore this project
more directly.

During the sprint I managed to get *gotu.gaia* limping along again.
I really need to unify *wits* and *gaia*.

I am starting a *gotu.jwst* module.  The plan is to be able to explore
the data behind some of the incredible images the space telescope is
giving us.
