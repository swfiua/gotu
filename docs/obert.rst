==========================
 like the universe itself
==========================

a goal in life to be a mother

planting the seeds

unpredictable irrational and complex

bayesian priors determining our future

at this time we are all out of control
of the future or are we

someone said everything is perfect sit back and let it happen

sometimes you cant control the thing that matters most and attempts to control
make matters worse

were in a random walk and its the big hills with broad wide plateaus
that are good

follow the gradient look for an edge with a view and dont forget to
look up or any other direction you might not know about

how much of your future is down to your priors and how of much of the
space are your priors excluding
