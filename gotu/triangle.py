"""It is a book about geometry.

Page 8/9 and it is all triangles with equal areas and somehow it all
relates to conservation of angular momentum.

We are busy proving Kepler's laws, that a line segment joining a planet
to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

Angular momentum is a frequent visitor in this story.

When I hear *angular momentum*, there is an implied rotation, but
about what axis?
