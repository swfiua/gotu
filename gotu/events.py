"""Space-time

Colin recommends readers take a look at Appendix A, for an
introduction to the basic concepts of realtivity.

At the start of chapter 2 important facts and concepts from the
appendix are enumerated.

1. An event is a point in space-time.   A place and a time, if you like.

2. Causality.  Events A and B are causally related if it is possible
for a signal, travelling at or below the speed of light, to pass from
A to B.

3. Observers and world lines.  An observer or world-line, is a path in
space time with each point pre-ceding later points.

4. Relativity of space and time.  Space and time are relative concepts
which depend on the observer.

5. Constancy of the speed of light.  The speed of light (measured in a
vacuum) is the same for all observers.

6. Intertial frames and observers.  Frames in which Newton's laws hold
to a first order and obervers are stationary in such frames.  Inertial
frames exist and to first order the geometry of an inertial fram is
the same as Minkowski space.


7. The laws of physics are unchanged by uniform linear motion.

8. Einstein's general equivalence principle.  All systems of
referenece are equivalent with respect to the formulation of the
fundamental laws of physics.
