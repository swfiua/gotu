Where Is The Sun?
=================

This turns out to be part of this mystery in our story.

Of course, we know where the Sun is, but where is it in relation to
the rest of our galaxy?

Where is the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way?

The conventional wisdom is that Sagittarius A* is an impressive sized
black hole, around 4 million times the mass of our sun.

Impressive though this is, it is nowhere near large enough to drive a
good sized spiral galaxy.

A mass of tens if not hundreds of billions times the mass of the sun
is required.

Let's see if astropy can help.

Astropy
=======

It seems astropy can help a great deal.  

It is not long before we encounter coordinate reference frames.

A coordinate or frame in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS).

Running help(coordinates.GCRS) lead me to this link:

https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602086

It is a wonderful paper discussing the subtleties of celestial frames
of reference.   

Earth based astronomy is very interested in how the earth rotates and
moves, but is also vey interested in the whole solar system as that
has an impact on how the earth moves.

The GCRS reference introduces different ways to measure time: the
earth's rotation versus the vibration of an atomic clock.

If we ignore time, briefly, GCRS introduces a geocentric coordinate
system for space.  There is a related reference system called ICRS, which is centred 

The positions of a catalogue of distant fixed stars is used to define
a fixed frame in space, centered on earth at a point in time.

Our observations are now of such precision that a tiny wobble, or
nutation, of the earth as it spins on its axis, needs to be taken into
account to make observations.  It is possible to predict this nutation
out some considerable time into the future (???).

Where is the centre of our galaxy?
==================================

According to :ref:`gotu`

Sgr A* is just about half-way in towards the centre from the Sun.  It
is roughly on line to the centre, but visibly NOT directly on line.

It appears to have recently moved into a star producing region (page
119) which accounts for the *paradox of youth* whereby many of its
stars appear to be young, so it could be inside an active arm.

With a little work on the :ref:`gaia` module it should be possible to
zoom into the gaia data and get an idea of the view around Sgr A*, or
indeed any other location across the galaxy.
