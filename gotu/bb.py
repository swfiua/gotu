"""The big bang theory.

What is the problem?

In many respects the big bang theory is an excellent theory.  

It does seem to fit the observations very well.

We see everything receding faster, the further back in time we look.

If we reverse this movie, surely at some point it was all crushed into
almost nothing?

Is there not an excellent model for such a universe, and a whole
llambda cold dark matter model that fits everything perfectly?
