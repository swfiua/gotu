"""The big bang theory.

What is the problem?

In many respects the big bang theory is an excellent theory.  

It does seem to fit the observations very well.

We see everything receding faster, the further back in time we look.

If we reverse this movie, surely at some point it was all crushed into
almost nothing?

Is there not an excellent model for such a universe, and a whole
llambda cold dark matter model that fits everything perfectly?

The short answer is that the Big Bang Theory requires numerous fixes
to convential physics in order to match the observations, including
harmonics in the cosmic microwave background.

These harmonics are very much easier to explain if the universe is
very much older than the 13.7 billion years of the big bang theory.

:ref:`gotu` shows how an essentially static universe would appear as
an expanding universe.
