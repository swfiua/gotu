"""Conversing with chatgpt about the geometry of the universe.

It generated the code below when asked::

   Write python code to explore geodesics in de Sitter space

I have found chatgpt's willingness to answer questions regarding
astrophysics quite refreshing, as well as somewhat helpful.

I have started updating the code that chatgpt produced, as I want to
see how things change as you vary the initial conditions.

For now, I have had to change things around a bit so I can run the code 
with blume.

After playing with this a little, and switching to solve_ivp to avoid
some numerical madness, the geodesics aren't behaving quite how I might expect.

Time to go down the rabbit hole of curvature.

I am currently trying to reconcile the equations implicit in the
geodesic function with the presentation in the geometry of the universe.

Here, geodesics all converge to the origin eventually.
