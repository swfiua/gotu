"""Pulsar timing array detects ultra-low frequency gravitational waves


The news on 29 June 2023 very much lived up to the hype.

Observational astronomy is going through an incredible period.

An observatory tracking the timing of 68 pulsars over 15 years has
detected gravitational waves with wavelenths of years -- that's the
distance light travels in a year.

Since the waves travel at the speed of light, it's also the time it
takes for one wavelength, hence the frequency is in nanohertz.

They have detected a wobble in space time of the order of 10m per
light year.

It is an incredible collaboration.  It was even necessary to improve
our estimates of the movement of Jupiter, using observations from a
Jupiter space-probe, in order to know the position of the earth
relative to the solar system's centre of mass.

Very interestingly the wave detected is approximately twice the amplitude they were expecting to find, given their models.

These models assume we are seeing waves from the mergers of black
holes at the centre of galaxies.

This observation comes at a time when astrophysicists are struggling
to explain how galaxies got so large, so soon after the big bang.

Professor Colin Rourke suggests that the Big Bang never happened. He
proposes *de Sitter Space* as a natural model for the universe.

*de Sitter Space* is much misunderstood.

The big bang model has precisely half the matter in the universe.

The expanding universe we see is balanced by a contracting flow too.

When this matter is added back in, bingo the amplitude of the wave
will be twice what the teams modelling predicted!

The observations will also be able to build a map over time showing
how the amplitude of waves differs in different parts of the sky.

I predict that this map will match the Cosmic Microwave Background.

I expect teams are already looking at this.  If it is found it would
indicate that both the waves and the CMB have the same source.

This will be taken as confirmation of the big bang theory and a
fantasy period of merging galaxies, that we do not see.

What we are seeing is the sum of the rotations of all black holes in
our visible universe.

As Professor Rourke suggests, these black holes drag the surrounding
spacetime by::

         w m / r

Where m is the black hole mass, w (or omega) is the hole's angular
velocity and r is the distance from the hole.

This is known as the *Sciama Principle*, by Dennis Sciama, who proposed
a theory of gravity based on the principle.

The factor of 1/r is controversial, as the unique solution to
Einstein's general relativity, in as vacuum gives the Kerr metric,
which drops off by 1 / r^3.

The solution to this conundrum, is that space is not a vacuum and so
the Kerr metric does not apply.

Now returning to nano-gravity.  The models that are being used assume
the waves are from inspirals of super massive black holes, rather than
just the direct rotations of the black holes themselves (see above re
Kerr metric).

Nonetheless, the waves are commensurate with the Schwartzchild radius
of the black holes, with magnitude proportional to the mass and
presumably dropping off with distance by a factor of 1/r.

For a radius in years, we need 10^11 solar masses.

Note also that the effect is dominated by distant galaxies, as is the
CMB, since the number of galaxies at a given distance goes up with
r^2.

What about the high frequency waves LIGO is detecting?

These are the analogue of gamma-ray-bursts as describing in `gotu`.
